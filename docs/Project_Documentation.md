### Database schema

![Database Schema](server/DB_schema.png)

## Dataset specification

The structure is defined as follows:

### Components

    - `Data`: Represents a single column of a table. It is a QStringList, where each QString is an individual cell value in the column.
    - `Dataset`: Represents the entire table. It is a QHash that maps a QString key to a Data object. The key is used to identify each column.

Dataset is actually a `map<key, value>`, where `key is a string` and `value is a list of strings`

Dataset could store data `entities`. All possible entities are described below. 

If some key is not specified, it has `{ "" }` value as a placeholder for the list of strings.

### Entities

#### Result

If error key exists, it mean that error occured (even if message is empty).

| Key   | Value                   |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| error | { "error description" } |

#### User
| Key      | Value            |

| id       | { "0" }          |
| username | { "MyLogin" }    |
| password | { "MyPassword" } |
| roleId   | { "0" }          |

#### Role
| Key  | Value               |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| id   | { "0" }             |
| name | { "Administrator" } |

#### PurchaseOrder
| Key         | Value                     |

## REST API

Below you could find spesification for different RESTful API request-response. 

### Config

| Method | URL                            | Description                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `http://localhost:8000/config` | Fetch recommended client configuration |

Current configuration structure:

| Field               | Value                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `apiUrl`            | `http://localhost:8000/api` |
| `serializationType` | `json`          |

Before you start to use next API Endpoints you should to remember that REST API url starts with `/api` endpoint
For example `http://localhost:8000/api/sales`

### Endpoints

Request or Response are one of entities described above. 

Important: `User[username, password]` - data specified in `[]` tell about important keys, that must be present. It means that else keys are optional.

As for the cases of simple entity name `User`, it just means that all keys must be presented and be valid.

About arrays: Request or Response is array of entities if it's specified as `array<User>`
